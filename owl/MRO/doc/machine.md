| **OWL Type:** | _Class_ |
| **Concept Elucidation:** | A machine is a [tool or device] that consists of one or more parts (interrelated and each with separate and definite function) and, as a whole, used in the performance of some kind tasks by transformation of chemical, thermal, electrical, or nuclear energy into mechanical energy, or vice versa or transmitting or modifying force, motion, and energy one to another in a predetermined manner.|

| **Related Domain Resources:** | _Wikipedia:_ A machine is a tool that consists of one or more parts, and uses energy to achieve a particular goal. <br> _Encyclopedia Britannica:_ machine, device, having a unique purpose, that augments or replaces human or animal effort for the accomplishment of physical tasks. The operation of a machine may involve the transformation of chemical, thermal, electrical, or nuclear energy into mechanical energy, or vice versa, or its function may simply be to modify and transmit forces and motions. <br> _Dictionary.com:_ an apparatus consisting of interrelated parts with separate functions, used in the performance of some kind of work. <br> _Merriam Webster:_ an assemblage of parts that transmit forces, motion, and energy one to another in a predetermined manner. <br> _Reference.com:_ a device that transmits or modifies force or motion. <br> _Oxford_ an apparatus using mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task.|
| **Comments:** | Traits of a machine are: <br> Consists of one or more parts. <br> The parts have some interrelation. <br> Each part may have separate and definite function. <br> As a whole used in the performance of some kind tasks <br> may transform chemical, thermal, electrical, or nuclear energy into mechanical energy or vice versa. <br> may transmit or modify force, motion, and energy one to another in a predetermined manner. <br><br> Machine is narrower than tool. It may be narrower than device or equivalent.|

| **Semantic Relation Level:** | _The level of semantic relationship between the Concept and the Target Ontology entities: (one of) i) Equivalence (strong mapping) (e.g. owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty), ii) Strong Hierarchical (e.g. rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf), iii) Weak Hierarchical (e.g. skos:narrower, skos:broader), iii) Similarity (e.g. skos:related)._ |
| **Mapping Axioms:** | _Proposed mapping axiom (or axioms) between the Concept entity and the Target Ontology entities in a OWL2 compliant syntax (e.g. Turtle, Manchester, RDF/XML, Functional-Style, OWL/XML)._ |
