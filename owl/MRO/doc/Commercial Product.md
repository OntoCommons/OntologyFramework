### General Concept Info:

| **IRI:** | _Suggested entity new IRI._ |
| --- | --- |
| **OWL Type:** | Class |
| **Concept Elucidation:** | A Commercial Product is something which is explicitly offered on the market for purchase or barter. Commercial Products can consist in the outcome of some kind of practical and/or intellectual activity, or in the access to some benefits. <br><br> In the first scenario, the activity needn’t necessarily have been performed, directly, or indirectly, by the organization or individual offering the Commercial Product on the market, and the activity itself needn’t involve a transformation of the item which is then offered for purchase. In the second case, the benefit has to be made directly, or indirectly, available by the organization or individual offering the Commercial Product on the market, and the access to the relevant benefit can be temporary (be the duration predetermined or not) or permanent. <br><br> Commercial Products can either belong to the purchaser for an indefinite period of time after the completion of a transaction, or the transference of their ownership might not figure as a condition for the completion of the transaction. They can indifferently be either tangible or intangible, artefacts or not artefacts. Likewise, they can indifferently be e.g., raw materials, processed materials, goods, intellectual properties, and services. <br><br> Domain: Economics - Business – Marketing|

Provision of a service can involve, for example, the following: — an activity performed on a customer-supplied tangible product (e.g. automobile to be repaired); — an activity performed on a customer-supplied intangible product (e.g. the income statement needed to prepare a tax return); — the delivery of an intangible product (e.g. the delivery of information in the context of knowledge transmission); — the creation of ambience for the customer (e.g. in hotels and restaurants). Software consists of information and is generally intangible and can be in the form of approaches, transactions or procedures. Hardware is generally tangible and its amount is a countable characteristic. Processed materials are generally tangible and their amount is a continuous characteristic”; “adapted from ISO 14021:1999 and ISO 9000:2005”.|
| **Comments:** | This engineered OntoCommons bridge-concept aims to provide an extremely general umbrella notion focused on a few defining traits for a family of concepts which are pivotal in business practice, from the perspective of industrial stakeholders. The decision to follow this strategy was made in accordance with the requests coming from MLOs’ stakeholders given OntoCommons’ survey.  <br><br> The defining trait grouping up the relevant individuals was identified in their being actually, and explicitly, offered for purchase or barter on the market; the choice to include the two specifications above (actuality and explicitness) being due to the fact that, in principle, almost anything can be sold, and implicit availability for purchase or barter seemed inadequate given the aims of the project, and harder to rein in.  <br><br> The focus is on the economic aspects; though the term is also associated with manufacturing/transformative ones, which can arguably be the basis for a different bridge-concept. A composite characterisation of the concept, possibly closer to the term’s use, would have run the risk of being vague and, thus, incapable of capturing in a formal way any of the underlying ideas. Again, a manufacturing-related characterisation also risked collapsing on quite different notions, related to the concepts of (generic) Output (of a process) or Equipment, as they are commonly characterised and understood. It was decided to focus specifically on one direction of the transaction to address and avoid ambiguities which might arise, in practice, in ontologies built specifically for industrial usage.  <br><br> Given the incompatibility of golden standards (ISO 9000 and ISO 14040, inter alia and significantly), on the notion of product, a choice had to be made: in line with what has been said above, it was decided to follow more closely ISO 14040, explicitly addressing all the divergences which might have otherwise resulted in ambiguities. The choice was also influenced by the fact that ISO 14040’ definition is closer to the ones put forward in other well-known resources. That said, ISO 9000 is extensively referenced in the definition of the OntoCommons bridge-concept Article (Commercial), and the standard is also directly taken into account in the definition of two other OntoCommons bridge-concepts: Good (Commercial) and Service (Commercial), whereas all these concepts belong to the OntoCommons concept cluster hinged on Commercial Product.  <br><br> It should be added that, while an analysis of a selected sample of ontologies showed that a narrower concept might have avoided issues pertaining to alignment arising from trans-categoricity, the preemptive investigation also made patent an implicit preference (if not a need) of stakeholders for a broad concept of product (closer to ISO 14040), at least when MLOs were concerned.  <br><br> Other possibly problematic points were addressed by making traits’ values/value gaps explicit, value gaps being prevalent due to the organisation of the concept cluster and the broadness of the bridge-concept Commercial Product; a more in-depth explanation of some of the relevant traits/values can be found in the comments to the elucidations of other bridge-concepts belonging to the cluster: Commercial Product. It was also decided not to list “paradigmatic  (yet not strictly necessary) characteristics” in order to avoid introducing biases which might have affected domain experts, ontologists, and generic users alike. |

## Concept's cluster:
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Cluster:** | Commercial Product |
| **Cluster relations:** | The Engineered OntoCommons bridge-concept Commercial Product is the core of the Cluster: Commercial Product.  <br><br> Article (Commercial) and Service (Commercial) are engineered in a way such that they jointly exhaust Commercial Product’s logical space; as a result of that, Article (Commercial) and Service (Commercial) are rdfs:subClassOf Commercial Product, and Commercial Product is rdfs:equivalentClass the union of Article (Commercial) and Service (Commercial). Likewise, Good (Commercial) and Intellectual Article (Commercial) are engineered in a way such that they jointly exhaust Article (Commercial)’s logical space; as a result of that, Good (Commercial) and Intellectual Article (Commercial) are rdfs:subClassOf Article (Commercial), and Article (Commercial) is rdfs:equivalentClass the union of Intellectual Article (Commercial) and Good (Commercial).  <br><br> The bridge-concepts belonging to the cluster are organized hierarchically focusing on core traits and traits-values, to the end of engineering strong semantic links capable of supporting mediated alignments. The traits are chosen in a way which maximizes coherence with existing standards and ease of alignment with ontologies, given commonly employed ontological theoretical choices/background assumptions.  <br><br> Specifically, the first partition of Commercial Product’s logical space -by means of the bridge-concepts Article (Commercial) and Service (Commercial)- attempts to capture the common-sense-friendly distinction between services and other things that can be purchased, often identified by means of labels such as ‘goods’ and ‘merchandise’. The trait chosen to distinguish the two pertains to economics, in line with the concepts’ domain: ownership transference upon purchase. An Article’s ownership is transferred to the purchaser as a necessary condition for the completion of a transaction, while Services needn’t involve ownership transferences not pertaining to legal rights. As a result of that, Articles can e.g., be fully returned to the seller, and can be separated from the latter, while that does not hold for Services. Yet these further traits/trait-values are to be considered derivative and indicative: not such as to characterise the distinction. It is often common to distinguish between Services and Products which are not Services by means of another trait: tangibility. Services are said to be intangible, while Products which are not Services are said to be tangible. While, as a rule of thumb, this might appear prima facie correct, the characterisation is problematic when it comes to certain Articles, and the trait is not overall neutral given different possible ontological background assumptions. As such, tangibility has not been deemed a trait capable of providing a rigorous and neutral partition. Again, it is worth pointing out that Services and other Products are actually often paired in practical cases of transactions: for instance, a transaction involving a typical good, such as an household appliance, often encompasses delivery and is affected by considerations related to availability, which pertain to services; likewise, a typical service, such as a high end restaurant consumption, de facto involves food/beverage ownership-transferences, though they might not be the focus of the transaction. It is thus important not to assume that products cannot be “internally composite”, and/or need to stand in a 1:1 relation with transactions. Ultimately the ancillary element, when present, is decided by the focus of the transaction.  <br><br> The second partition of the logical space (of Article (Commercial)) -by means of the bridge-concepts Good (Commercial) and Intellectual Article (Commercial)- attempts to capture the common-sense-friendly distinction between intellectual and material assets (“properties”, in the economic sense). The trait chosen to distinguish the two partitions is quite complex, in order to avoid counter-examples while preserving neutrality:  association with a specific material entity which doesn’t merely act as a legal placeholder or as a contingent medium to the end of completing a transaction. Goods are associated, and often appear entirely reducible, to material entities which do not merely act as legal placeholders or as contingent mediums to the end of completing transactions, while Intellectual Articles aren’t. As a result of that, the OntoCommons bridge-concept, Intellectual Article (Commercial) arguably covers all the so-called intellectual properties (which are explicitly offered on the market for purchase and whose ownership is transferred to the purchaser upon completion of a transaction). As a general note, while pertaining to economics and related to jurisprudence, the particular bridge-concepts, and the cluster overall, do not aim at capturing neutral and hypothetically universally valid legal notions, and lack well-known specifications in the relevant domains; the level of detail of the proposed definitions was deemed appropriate given the aims of the project, and the synchronic and diachronic heterogeneity of legislations. <br><br> The resulting engineered cluster of bridge-concepts, hinged on the OntoCommons bridge-concept Commercial Product -covering and organising the logical space of core concepts in business practice- is arguably de facto aligned with golden standards (as explicitly argued for in the comments to the knowledge domain resources for each of the particular bridge-concepts), and -at the same time- respectful of possible discrepancies in ontological representation given background assumptions which do not strictly pertain to the economic domain the concept cluster belongs to. The partitions should be conductive to conceptual clarity while at the same time facilitating alignments which would have otherwise been hardly possible, at least in some cases, as argued for in (some of) the mapping elucidations for the bridge-concepts belonging to the concept cluster, and Commercial Product & Article (Commercial) in particular: in fact, the bridge-concept Commercial Product, much like many broad concepts belonging to the business/legal areas, is trans-categorical given partitions of the logical space commonly employed by most Top Level Ontologies, and some of the ontologies belonging to the OntoCommons EcoSystem for what concerns us here (BFO and DOLCE). The conceptual cluster has thus the further benefit of ensuring more precise and informative mappings, automatically connecting single ontologies to a well-defined conceptual architecture. |

## Alignments To Existing Ontologies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Target Ontology:** | BFO: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl> |
| **Related Ontology Entities:** |Alignment mediated by other bridge-concepts belonging to the Concept Cluster: Commercial Product |
| **Mapping Elucidation:** | BFO is arguably organised in a way that makes the broad concept of product here considered -practically, if not necessarily- trans-categorical. Specifically, BFO arguably lacks a unified and straightforward representation of scenarios involving things up for purchase. In order to circumvent this problem, the alignment has thus to be mediated by other, non-trans-categorical (modulo-BFO) concepts. The alignment is made all the more challenging by the fact that economic/legal concepts are hard to pin down in a neutral and universally valid fashion, and the resulting alignments still cannot be all 1:1 due to the explicit expressive power of the relevant TLO, by means of single classes. Nonetheless, it is arguably possible to put forward a direct link for Goods (Commercial), and (more problematically) for Service (Commercial), and outline necessary conditions for Intellectual Article (Commercial), recomposing Commercial Product’s logical space. The specific links are investigated in the pertinent templates, while the semantic links defining the cluster are examined in the relevant section below. |

| **Related Ontology Entities:** | Alignment mediated by other bridge-concepts belonging to the Concept Cluster: Commercial Product |
| **Mapping Elucidation:** | Much of what has been said with respect to BFO holds, mutatis mutandis, for DOLCE, though the latter has a high tolerance for reifications (being grounded in common sense), resulting in an increased explicit expressive power. Due to that, it’s possible to establish (comparatively) more straightforward 1:1 connections via the other bridge-concepts belonging to the OntoCommons concept cluster: Commercial Product, specifically in the case of Intellectual Articles (Commercial). The specific links are investigated in the pertinent templates, while the semantic links defining the cluster are examined in the relevant section below. |

| **Mapping Elucidation:** | In EMMO, the holistic perspective represents entities according to their relations to the whole. Given EMMO’s framework and background assumptions, it seems appropriate to look for a connection with the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Commercial Product, in this branch. EMMO:Role, or one of its subclasses, seems to be an appropriate candidate for a meaningful connection, though it should be noted that the same entity could be represented differently under different guises (and not as something that is being explicitly offered on the market for purchase or barter). |
