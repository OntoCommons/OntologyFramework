| **Concept Elucidation:** | A tool is an object (sometimes natural, that is used either directly or with some 'minimal' modification) that is employed, either being held/attached externally by/to an individual (a human, animal, or a machine - an user of the tool) or being unattached from the user, to extend the user's ability to modify the material properties (form, position, or condition) of its surrounding environment (may be another object or some objects) or the user itself.|

| **Related Domain Resources:** | _Wikipedia:_ A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment. "a tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools. Early tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for preparation of food, hunting, manufacture of weapons, and working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts"; "there is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work. Personal protective equipment includes such items as gloves, safety glasses, ear defenders and biohazard suits". <br> The external employment of an unattached or manipulable attached environmental object to alter more efficiently the form, position, or condition of another object, another organism, or the user itself, when the user holds and directly manipulates the tool during or prior to use and is responsible for the proper and effective orientation of the tool. (Shumaker et al., 2011) <br> The use of physical objects other than the animal's own body or appendages as a means to extend the physical influence realized by the animal. (Jones and Kamil, 1973) <br> An object that has been modified to fit a purpose ... [or] An inanimate object that one uses or modifies in some way to cause a change in the environment, thereby facilitating one's achievement of a target goal. (Hauser, 2000) <br> _Encyclopedia Britannica:_ Tool, an instrument for making material changes on other objects, as by cutting, shearing, striking, rubbing, grinding, squeezing, measuring, or other processes. A hand tool is a small manual instrument traditionally operated by the muscular strength of the user, and a machine tool is a power-driven mechanism used to cut, shape, or form materials such as wood and metal. Tools are the primary means by which human beings control and manipulate their physical environment".<br> _Dictionary.com:_ 1) an implement, especially one held in the hand, as a hammer, saw, or file, for performing or facilitating mechanical operations. 2) any instrument of manual operation. <br> _Merriam Webster:_ 1) a handheld device that aids in accomplishing a task. 2) the cutting or shaping part in a machine or machine tool. <br> _Oxford_ a device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function.|
