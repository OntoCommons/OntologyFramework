| **Comments:** | Equipment is very similar to resouce. They can be machine, tool, or infrustructure but called and equipment when alllocated for a particular job.|


## Alignments To Existing Ontologies:

| --- | --- |
| **Target Ontology:** | _Existing IRI of the ontology that will express the concept according to its logical framework (concept alignment)._ |
| **Related Ontology Entities:** | _List of terms and IRIs of the Target Ontology entities that are relevant for the concept (documentation is supposed to be accessible through the target ontology)._ |
| **Mapping Elucidation:** | _Natural language description of the mapping choice and motivations._ |
| **Semantic Relation Level:** | _The level of semantic relationship between the Concept and the Target Ontology entities: (one of) i) Equivalence (strong mapping) (e.g. owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty), ii) Strong Hierarchical (e.g. rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf), iii) Weak Hierarchical (e.g. skos:narrower, skos:broader), iii) Similarity (e.g. skos:related)._ |
| **Mapping Axioms:** | _Proposed mapping axiom (or axioms) between the Concept entity and the Target Ontology entities in a OWL2 compliant syntax (e.g. Turtle, Manchester, RDF/XML, Functional-Style, OWL/XML)._ |
