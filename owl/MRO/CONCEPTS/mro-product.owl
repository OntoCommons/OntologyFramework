In this case, the lack of a shared common ground might not have immediate consequence for stakeholders, but there is a serious risk of compromising some of the most notable advantages in data exchange via ontologies, and, specifically having to do with reusability and the overall network’s predictive potential. 
Ultimately, as a result of a survey of the related concepts appearing in MLOs, it was decided to put forward a very general Atom bridge-concept, and explicitly specify value gaps with respect to two characteristic traits: net charge and bonds. Thus, a neutral atom and a charged atom (ion) are joint into the concept Atom, and the same goes for Standalone Atoms and Bonded Atoms. 
It should be noted that this last point solves a serious representational issue whereas atoms are considered as mereological parts of molecules, as many resources (and even golden standards such as the IUPAC, do: <https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.M04002>. There was in fact an effort to ensure that the proposed bridge-concept would be aligned with said golden standard, even relatively to the definition/elucidation itself. 
The trait of “being the smallest particle still characterising a chemical element” was explicitly stated to be domain specific, for the sake of clarity: in line with that, it was decided not to include the trait “basic unit of matter”, even though it could point to a taxonomical, hierarchical, informative characteristic. Notably, the resulting definition is also not too far from the ones provided by well known and pervasively employed domain resources, such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, WordNet and the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
The trait of being “indivisible”, appearing in Wikidata’s has been deemed obsolete and potentially confusing qua too close too the notion of Mereological Atom, which cannot be ignored due to Mereology’s pervasiveness in formal ontologies. It is factually possible to split Atoms into their subatomic components, and Encyclopedia Britannica’s definition depicts a vastly more accurate picture."""@en ;

In general, as far as BFO’s distinctions are concerned, Atoms do not seem to be vastly different from moderate-sized specimens of dry goods such as tables and bricks. 
Arguably, the real question concerns whether the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Atom, is a subclass of BFO:Object, BFO:Object Aggregate, or BFO:Fiat Object (which is arguably the rightful categorisation for a restriction of Atom via the bonded trait); however the classes are not mutually disjoint as the relevant BFO universals are not rigid, so the questions is, to a degree, meaningless. 
In fact, the possibility of the relevant individuals of migrating among the classes seems especially appropriate in this specific scenario. There do not seem to be reasons to consider a different alignment, and the examples of usage appear to be pertinent. Despite the intuitive gap between Material Entities and Atoms, the connection seems informative and appropriate: in fact, 
it is pivotal to be wary of intuitions which might derive from unrelated considerations pertaining to concepts’ prototypes and scale. Finally, it is worth considering whether such an alignment is conductive to an appropriate representation of electron clouds, but -it could be argued- that would be putting the cart before the horse."""@en

However, the choice of a subclass, or, more specifically, of a tree of subclasses is in this case possible and informative. In DOLCE there is no distinction analogous to the one between BFO:Objects and BFO:Objects Aggregates; DOLCE:Arbitrary Sums plays a completely different role. As such, the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Atom, can be seen as a subclass of DOLCE:Physical Object. Given the further distinction between Dolce’s Agentive and Non Agentive Physical Objects, based on intentionality and the possess of desires and beliefs, the choice seems straightforward, bizarre philosophical options contrary to common-sense notwithstanding. Thus, the proposed bridge-concept Atom is arguably a subclass of DOLCE:Non Agentive Physical Object; the connection seems informative and appropriate, and it is made even more plausible given the examples of usage provided in the relevant documentation."@en

In fact, while the core trait concerning ownership-transference is arguably neutral with respect to the ontological categorisation, there are good reasons to think that services, characterised as accesses to benefits, have to occur over time, and should be understood specifically as processes (BFO:Process’s elucidation being in line with the common understanding of the notion). While presumably highly heterogeneous, services should all share some commonalities (e.g. involve independent continuants with certain deontological roles: costumer, provider); that being the case it seems appropriate to assume that the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Service (Commercial) should be linked with BFO:Process by means of the rdfs:subClassOf relation.

In fact, the sub-class of DOLCE:Perdurant, DOLCE:Process, seems analogous to BFO:Process under many respects, ontological significance first and foremost. Then again, the most informative candidate for a connection under the Perdurants-branch seems its super class: DOLCE:Stative, as some of the relevant cases might arguably be characterised as States given the core homeomericity trait. Still, DOLCE is not opposed to reifications, and it thus worth considering alternatives such as DOLCE:Non-Agentive Social Object for the connection.

The decision to follow this strategy was made in accordance with the requests coming from MLOs’ stakeholders given OntoCommons’ survey. 
The defining trait grouping up the relevant individuals was identified in their being actually, and explicitly, offered for purchase or barter on the market; the choice to include the two specifications above (actuality and explicitness) being due to the fact that, in principle, almost anything can be sold, and implicit availability for purchase or barter seemed inadequate given the aims of the project, and harder to rein in. 
The focus is on the economic aspects; though the term is also associated with manufacturing/transformative ones, which can arguably be the basis for a different bridge-concept. A composite characterisation of the concept, possibly closer to the term’s use, would have run the risk of being vague and, thus, incapable of capturing in a formal way any of the underlying ideas. Again, a manufacturing-related characterisation also risked collapsing on quite different notions, related to the concepts of (generic) Output (of a process) or Equipment, as they are commonly characterised and understood. It was decided to focus specifically on one direction of the transaction to address and avoid ambiguities which might arise, in practice, in ontologies built specifically for industrial usage. 
Given the incompatibility of golden standards (ISO 9000 and ISO 14040, inter alia and significantly), on the notion of product, a choice had to be made: in line with what has been said above, it was decided to follow more closely ISO 14040, explicitly addressing all the divergences which might have otherwise resulted in ambiguities. The choice was also influenced by the fact that ISO 14040’ definition is closer to the ones put forward in other well-known resources. That said, ISO 9000 is extensively referenced in the definition of the OntoCommons bridge-concept Article (Commercial), and the standard is also directly taken into account in the definition of two other OntoCommons bridge-concepts: Good (Commercial) and Service (Commercial), whereas all these concepts belong to the OntoCommons concept cluster hinged on Commercial Product.
It should be added that, while an analysis of a selected sample of ontologies showed that a narrower concept might have avoided issues pertaining to alignment arising from trans-categoricity, the preemptive investigation also made patent an implicit preference (if not a need) of stakeholders for a broad concept of product (closer to ISO 14040), at least when MLOs were concerned. 
Other possibly problematic points were addressed by making traits’ values/value gaps explicit, value gaps being prevalent due to the organisation of the concept cluster and the broadness of the bridge-concept Commercial Product; a more in-depth explanation of some of the relevant traits/values can be found in the comments to the elucidations of other bridge-concepts belonging to the cluster: Commercial Product. It was also decided not to list “paradigmatic  (yet not strictly necessary) characteristics” in order to avoid introducing biases which might have affected domain experts, ontologists, and generic users alike."""@en .
