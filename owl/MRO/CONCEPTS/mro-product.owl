rdfs:comment skos:definition """(Elucidation) An atom is a nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud. The nucleus consists of electrically positive protons and electrically neutral neutrons, and carries almost all of the atom’s mass; the electron cloud is a quantum system made of one or more bounded electrons, and is pivotal in determining the atom’s size and properties. 

It is the smallest system that has the characteristic properties of a chemical elements and, as such, it is often employed as a unit in the domain of chemistry. 

Atoms can either be standalone or bonded; they can have an unbalanced number of electrons with respect to their atomic number (the latter being determined by the number of protons in the nucleus) or have a net electric charge."""@en .

   rdfs:comment "BFO’s taxonomy is hinged on the distinction between Occurrents and Continuants; the ontology is also strongly opposed to reification and allows only “spatial” entities under BFO:Immaterial Entity, on the side of Continuants. Together, these two points hint at the fact that BFO:Occurrent, or one of its subclasses, should be the most suited candidate for the establishment of an informative connection. In fact, while the core trait concerning ownership-transference is arguably neutral with respect to the ontological categorisation, there are good reasons to think that services, characterised as accesses to benefits, have to occur over time, and should be understood specifically as processes (BFO:Process’s elucidation being in line with the common understanding of the notion). While presumably highly heterogeneous, services should all share some commonalities (e.g. involve independent continuants with certain deontological roles: costumer, provider); that being the case it seems appropriate to assume that the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Service (Commercial) should be linked with BFO:Process by means of the rdfs:subClassOf relation.

It is thus prima facie reasonable to begin looking for a connections starting from the subclasses of DOLCE:Perdurant, on the basis of the similarities between DOLCE:Perdurant and BFO:Occurrent. In fact, the sub-class of DOLCE:Perdurant, DOLCE:Process, seems analogous to BFO:Process under many respects, ontological significance first and foremost. Then again, the most informative candidate for a connection under the Perdurants-branch seems its super class: DOLCE:Stative, as some of the relevant cases might arguably be characterised as States given the core homeomericity trait. Still, DOLCE is not opposed to reifications, and it thus worth considering alternatives such as DOLCE:Non-Agentive Social Object for the connection. However, it is far from clear whether the resulting conceptualisation would be satisfactory in all -or even in most- cases which fall under the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Service (Commercial), so the first option considered seems ultimately more informative/appropriate.

Ultimately, as a result of a survey of the related concepts appearing in MLOs, it was decided to put forward a very general Atom bridge-concept, and explicitly specify value gaps with respect to two characteristic traits: net charge and bonds. Thus, a neutral atom and a charged atom (ion) are joint into the concept Atom, and the same goes for Standalone Atoms and Bonded Atoms. 
It should be noted that this last point solves a serious representational issue whereas atoms are considered as mereological parts of molecules, as many resources (and even golden standards such as the IUPAC, do: <https://doi.org/10.1351/goldbook.M04002>. There was in fact an effort to ensure that the proposed bridge-concept would be aligned with said golden standard, even relatively to the definition/elucidation itself. 
The trait of “being the smallest particle still characterising a chemical element” was explicitly stated to be domain specific, for the sake of clarity: in line with that, it was decided not to include the trait “basic unit of matter”, even though it could point to a taxonomical, hierarchical, informative characteristic. Notably, the resulting definition is also not too far from the ones provided by well known and pervasively employed domain resources, such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, WordNet and the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
The trait of being “indivisible”, appearing in Wikidata’s has been deemed obsolete and potentially confusing qua too close too the notion of Mereological Atom, which cannot be ignored due to Mereology’s pervasiveness in formal ontologies. It is factually possible to split Atoms into their subatomic components, and Encyclopedia Britannica’s definition depicts a vastly more accurate picture."""@en ;

Arguably, the real question concerns whether the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Atom, is a subclass of BFO:Object, BFO:Object Aggregate, or BFO:Fiat Object (which is arguably the rightful categorisation for a restriction of Atom via the bonded trait); however the classes are not mutually disjoint as the relevant BFO universals are not rigid, so the questions is, to a degree, meaningless. 
In fact, the possibility of the relevant individuals of migrating among the classes seems especially appropriate in this specific scenario.

Despite the intuitive gap between Material Entities and Atoms, the connection seems informative and appropriate: in fact, 
it is pivotal to be wary of intuitions which might derive from unrelated considerations pertaining to concepts’ prototypes and scale.

In DOLCE there is no distinction analogous to the one between BFO:Objects and BFO:Objects Aggregates; DOLCE:Arbitrary Sums plays a completely different role. As such, the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Atom, can be seen as a subclass of DOLCE:Physical Object. Given the further distinction between Dolce’s Agentive and Non Agentive Physical Objects, based on intentionality and the possess of desires and beliefs, the choice seems straightforward, bizarre philosophical options contrary to common-sense notwithstanding.

Commercial Products can consist in the outcome of some kind of practical and/or intellectual activity, or in the access to some benefits. 
In the first scenario, the activity needn’t necessarily have been performed, directly, or indirectly, by the organization or individual offering the Commercial Product on the market, and the activity itself needn’t involve a transformation of the item which is then offered for purchase. In the second case, the benefit has to be made directly, or indirectly, available by the organization or individual offering the Commercial Product on the market, and the access to the relevant benefit can be temporary (be the duration predetermined or not) or permanent.
Commercial Products can either belong to the purchaser for an indefinite period of time after the completion of a transaction, or the transference of their ownership might not figure as a condition for the completion of the transaction. They can indifferently be either tangible or intangible, artefacts or not artefacts. Likewise, they can indifferently be e.g., raw materials, processed materials, goods, intellectual properties, services.""" ;
