        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This engineered OntoCommons bridge-concept aims to provide a MLO-friendly, pragmatic restriction of an extremely general family of notions which can be characterised in vastly different ways; notions which generally fall under the labels of ‘property’, ‘attribute’, ‘quality’, ‘characteristic’, ‘quantity’. Given the aim, the characteristics of the target MLOs, and, more importantly, the requests coming from MLOs’ stakeholders given OntoCommons’ survey, it was decided to focus on a list of features encompassing property quantification, the existence of a standardised and shared definition/procedure ensuring objectivity, and the relevant aspects being grounded -directly or indirectly- in actual, and not just possible (to restrict the number of problematic cases by avoiding merely hypothetical ones), observability. 
There was an effort to ensure that the proposed bridge-concept would be aligned with golden standards: specifically, it is in line with ISO 80000, which also provides a (nominally partial, yet extremely rich) extensional definition of the class; it is also aligned with ISO10303-45, though we ultimately decided to explicitly include quantities associated with physical objects which do not pertain to the domain of physics, understood as discipline, to ensure coverage of all the relevant MLOs, in line with our goals. Doing so also avoids some well-known issues related to demarcation problems. Notably, the resulting definition is compatible with the ones provided by well known and pervasively employed domain resources, such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, and another golden standard, the International Vocabulary of Metrology. This will ensure immediateness and intuitiveness for domain experts and ontologists, while at the same time improving the usability for non-experts. The risk of meaning/conceptual shift, and thus, obsoleteness, is also reduced. That said, the proposed definition cannot be reduced to said resources, insofar as it attempts to go beyond them explicitly pointing at possible pitfalls and nuances that need to be considered when attempting an alignment.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <emmo:EMMO_967080e5_2f42_4eb2_a3a9_c58143e835f9>Arguably, BFO’s Specifically Dependent Continuants cover the vast majority of the entities commonly labelled as ‘properties’ etc. -in line with what has been said above- in the guise of a metaphysical commitment to tropes. The ones which are not covered might be seen as falling under Generically Dependent Continuant, yet said class does not seem to be appropriate as an alignment target. BFO’s Role class is likewise not a good candidate, since they explicitly do not cover properties whose possession has consequences for the physical make-up of the bearer. As such, the only options left are Disposition and Quality. Given the focus on the observation process outlined in the proposed definition of Physical Quantity, it might be tempting to connect the latter to a specific kind of BFO:Disposition, yet that would mean vastly disregarding BFO’s background philosophical assumptions, internal organization, and factual approach to the description of similar cases. Taking those into account the proper connection is arguably with BFO:Quality. The Quality class is not restricted to quantities, nor bound by actual-observation grounding or the possibility of supporting quantification; as such the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Physical Quantity, can only be a subclass of the former.</emmo:EMMO_967080e5_2f42_4eb2_a3a9_c58143e835f9>

Analogously to BFO, DOLCE approaches properties via a commitment to tropes, though the relevant theoretical framework is fairly more complex. As such, it seems appropriate to look for a connection in the subclasses of DOLCE:Quality. The most pertinent target is arguably the class Physical Quality, which covers one of the core traits characterising the proposed bridge-concept, Physical Quantity. Since there are no explicit references to actual-observation grounding for the sake of generality, and qualities implicitly include non quantifiable properties, qua qualities,  the proposed OntoCommons bridge-concept, Physical Quantity, should be considered a specification of the relevant Dolce class, and, thus, a subclass of the latter. This last point is also supported by the explicit examples of usage provided in DOLCE’s documentation.</emmo:EMMO_967080e5_2f42_4eb2_a3a9_c58143e835f9>
